# Task Scheduling Algorithm Gamification Learning Platform
Task graph scheduling algorithms play an important role in many areas, but their abstract concepts make them difficult to learn. Gamification helps in learning by helping to understand the abstract concepts and increasing the learning interest. In order to explore whether gamification can play a positive role in teaching task graph scheduling algorithms, this project was developed.

This project has been temporarily deployed to a server and can be accessed directly via https://fluffy-souffle-3da1c0.netlify.app .
